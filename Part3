If I had access to a time machine, I would set the dial to around 2012. On a personal level, this time holds great significance because my family members who are no longer with us were alive then, and I would cherish the opportunity to spend 24 hours with them and express my love, gratitude, and appreciation through something as simple yet profound as a hug.

From a professional perspective, 2012 was also a pivotal moment in financial history with the early days of Bitcoin. The chance to witness firsthand the market dynamics and the transformative potential of cryptocurrencies at their infancy would be invaluable. This would provide unique insights into how disruptive technologies emerge, scale, and change the global financial landscapeâ€”lessons that are crucial in understanding innovation and staying ahead in a fast-evolving world.

This combination of personal meaning and professional foresight makes 2012 an ideal choice for me, as it balances emotional connections with strategic learning opportunities.
